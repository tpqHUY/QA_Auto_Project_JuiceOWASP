# Bug Reports

JIRA-style defect reports raised while testing OWASP Juice Shop `v17.1.1`
(Docker). Each demonstrates manual-QA reporting alongside the automation and,
where applicable, links to the automated test that covers it.

> Note: OWASP Juice Shop is intentionally vulnerable software. The security
> findings (BUG-003/004/005) are reported here as a QA exercise; they are
> confirmed against a locally-run instance, not any third-party system.
